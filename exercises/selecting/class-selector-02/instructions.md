## Select all paragraphs with a class of "`eanut`"

<!-- Here is a case where qualifying a class selector with the element's tag name is -->
<!-- important. You want to select only the paragraphs (`<p>`) that have the -->
<!-- "`eanut`" class and not the paragraphs without it nor the div (`<div>`) with -->
<!-- it. -->
